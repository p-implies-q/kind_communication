#+TITLE: A Guide to Kind Communication

* Preamble
This document will get to its core very quickly, and provide additional
information and explanation afterwards. However, if you find that you get along
well with the other members of the community, then you can stop reading here.
If, however, you find communication between you and others is tense, please
continue reading for ways that the situation might be resolved.

* The core

- Try your hardest to be kind.
- Failing that, try your hardest to be civil until you can be kind.
- Failing that, try your hardest to be quiet until you can be civil.
- Failing that, go away until you can be quiet.

* Explanation of terms

In this section I break down each of the four lines in the core. It is important
to remember that in communication you can take two roles, the producer of a
message and the consumer of a message. This distinction will return in the
breakdown of terms.

** Kind
Kindness comes from benevolence, from a desire for people to be free of pain and
suffering, from a desire for people to be happy and comfortable. Try to
cultivate an attitude of kindness in your dealings with others. If you act from
a genuine wish for the betterment of others and yourself, you are doing well.

Note that it is often kind to be gentle, but sometimes it is kind to be harsh as
well. If a young child puts a piece of glass in their mouth, the kindest thing
to do is get that piece of glass out as quickly as possible, even if scares or
hurts the child. In the same way, when there is a serious flaw or vulnerability
in someone's code, it is more important to be clear than it is to be gentle.
However, if you are actively abrasive this might scare them more than is
necessary and alienate them from further participation. Please exercise
discretion and try to act from an attitude of benevolence.

*** As a producer of a message
Try to keep in mind the person or people you are targetting your message at.
Every sentient being comes with their own insecurities, fears, hopes, and
desires. Every message you produce has consequences for the receivers of your
message. To be a kind messager means trying to convey your messages in such a
way that they have the greatest possible benevolent effects.

*** As the consumer of message
Assume that the producer of the message is acting with the best of intentions.
If a message seems harsh or unkind, investigate further. Perhaps the producer
was acting with your best intentions at heart?

If you come to the conclusion that the producer of the message made a serious
transgression of acceptable behavior, then assume clumsiness or ignorance before
malevolence.

Be content with civility. Sometimes kindness is hard to muster. Try to be really
good yourself, but be permissive of others.

** Civil
Kindness requires effort, and sometimes we are tired or stressed or fed up with
a particular individual in the community. These things happen. At this point, if
you truly lack the ability to be kind, fall back on civility. If you cannot find
it in yourself to act from a wish for the happiness and betterment of everyone
involved, at least try to do no harm.

Remind yourself that, when dealing with someone who seems particularly obtuse,
they probably aren't doing it to purposefully hurt you, so there is no reason to
try to hurt them back. Even if they are trying to hurt you, then getting hurt
and losing control is still giving them what they want.

Don't feel bad for having angry or aggressive thoughts, emotions or impulses.
The important thing is to control your intentional behavior.

If in doubt, err on the side of being overly formal.

*** As a producer of a message
If you have trouble remaining kind, then it is a good idea to reread your
message. Does it contain phrases that were formulated with the intent to harm or
belittle? Scrap those.

*** As the consumer of a message
Take the message at face value. Do not look for underlying motives or implied
messages. Take whatever was written literally and try to find a way to interpret
the message that is productive or useful.

** Quiet
If you can no longer control your urge to do harm, then it is better to do
nothing at all. Do not send messages, as a producer, and do not consume messages
as a consumer. Just take a break and let your emotions quiet down. We often feel
strongly and think things are very important, but then when the feelings quiet
down (and they always do), things take on a different perspective. Just wait for
that to happen and return to being civil, or even kind if you can manage it,
when your energy reserves have refilled.

** Go away for a bit
If it is really hard to remain quiet for a while, it might be time to put this
project down for a bit. Go work on something else for a while, go walking, take
up meditation, develop some perspective. You will always be welcomed back with
kindness when you can manage civility.


* Q&A

** Who is this document for?
This document is mainly aimed at open source software projects that feel
pressured to adopt some kind of Code of Conduct, either because the project
community doesn't get along very well with each other, or because there is
outside pressure from interest groups.

** How is this document different from standard Code of Conduct's?
Most CoC's I have read contain a series of rules (a lot of Don't's), many
ambiguously worded, and some kind of body of enforcement. They tend to put the
onus of offense on the offense giver, but thereby incentivize taking offense as
a way to win an argument.

This CoC focusses on Do's, on things you as an individual can do to improve
things, not on things you should police others on. Additionally, the
responsibilities outlined are equally strong for the producer of messages as the
consumer.

** Why no mention of [insert demographic]?
Because everyone deserves to be treated kindly, or at least civilly, regardless
of [insert defining trait].

** What should I do when someone I interact with keeps hurting me?
If there is a particular behavior that a person is showing that is intolerable
to you, please inform them of this and ask them if they can accomodate your
request. If the person reoffends, please remind them again. The correct amount
of times to remind someone is at least 3, more if you can manage it.

If the other person either refuses to adapt to your wishes, or is incapable of
meeting your request, and there is no way you can practically avoid interacting
with this person, then please bring the issue to the attention of <insert
contact people here> and they will make a discretionary judgement based on the
details of the case.

** This document is not perfect!
Although that is not a question... Yep, I agree. All of these documents are just
guidelines. If you see an improvement please submit a pull request. Real
conflict resolution is always going to be based on the details of a case.
